            <br /><strong>AI/Machine Learning Engineer</strong> with a background in Mechatronic Engineering and Software Development (enterprise & web).
            <br /><br />I have always been passionate about Computers and the ability to make them solve problems for us. I value encountering challenging situations, enjoy analyzing & solving problems and seeing the results. The work done by computers tend to have these characteristics in abundance. I am fascinated by that and want to solve as many problems as I can. Code is a by product of this phenomenon.
            <br /><br />Over time, I have acquired technical skills to code in Python, C, C++, Perl and few other languages. But again, I value the solving problems more than the tools used for that purpose.
            <br /><br />Strong believer in üëâüèæ <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@Synced/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264">"AI is the new Electricity"</a>.
