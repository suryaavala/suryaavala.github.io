    <br /><br />A bit of a background on how I got into the field and why I am still here -> I have always been passionate about Computers and the ability to make them solve problems for us. I value encountering challenging situations, enjoy analyzing & solving problems and seeing the results. The work done by computers tend to have these characteristics in abundance. I am fascinated by that and want to solve as many problems as I can. Code is a by product of this phenomenon. 
    <br />Over time, I have acquired technical skills to code in a bunch of languages, tools. But again, I value the solving problems more than the tools used for that purpose.

    <br /><br />Strong believer in üëâüèæ <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/fgbBtnCvcDI">"AI is the new Electricity"</a>.
